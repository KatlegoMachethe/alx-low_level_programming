Singly linked list
---
In this task we are going to look into singly linked list. We are going to learn when is it suitable to use linked lists as oposed to arrays and vise versa and why. The concepts learned from the resources were then applied to some practical coding exercises [0x12. C - Singly linked lists](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/projects/229).

Files

Below is a list of files and what they do in this piece of software:
- [0-print\_list.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/0-print_list.c) prints all element of the a the `list_t` list contained in the `lists.h` file.
- [1-list\_len.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/1-list_len.c) returns the numbr of elements in a linked `list_t` list.
- [2-add\_node.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/2-add_node.c) adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.
- [3-add\_node\_end.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/3-add_node_end.c) adds new node at the end of a `list_t` list.
- [4-free\_list.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/4-free_list.c) frees a `list_t` list.
- [lists.h](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/lists.h) has all the function prototypes used in this piece project.

All these files can be compiled on Ubuntu 20.14 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
