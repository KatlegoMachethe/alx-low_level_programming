Variadic functions
---
In this directory we look into the concept of variadic functions. We learn what are variadic functions and how to use the macros `va_start`, `va_arg` and `va_end` associated with these type of function. We also learn how an why to use the `const` type qualifier. All these are then applied to the practical coding exercises [0x010. C- Variadic functions](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/projects/227)  prescribed in the ALX SE program. Below is the list of all the file in this directory and what they do:
- [0-sum\_them\_all.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x10-variadic_functions/0-sum_them_all.c)	returns the sum of all its parameters.
- [1-print\_numbers.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x10-variadic_functions/1-print_numbers.c)	prints numbers.
- [2-print\_strings.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x10-variadic_functions/2-print_strings.c)	prints strings.
- [3-print\_all.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x10-variadic_functions/3-print_all.c)	prints anything.
- [variadic\_functions.h](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x10-variadic_functions/variadic_functions.h)	contains the prototypes for the functions in the `.c` files above.

These files can be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
