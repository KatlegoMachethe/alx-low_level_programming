C -File I/O
---
The objectives of this project is to learn what are files descriptor, how to use `create`, `open()`, `read()`, `write()` and `close()`functions on files, and how the input/output system calls these functions. We also learn how to use the flags `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY` and `O_RDWR` when creating file permissions. The second objective is to apply the concepts on some coding exercises [0x15. C - File I/O](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/projects) prescribed in the ALX SE program curriculum.

Files
---
Below is the list of files contained in this directory and what the do:
- [`0-read_textfile.c`]
- [`1-create_file.c`]
- [`2-append_text_to_file.c`]
- [`3-cp.c`]
- [`main.h`]

All these files are compiled using the command `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <filename> -o <executable filename>`
