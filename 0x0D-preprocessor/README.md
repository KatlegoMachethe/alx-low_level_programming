Preprocessor
---
In this directory we explore the C preprocessor. We learn what are macros and how to use them. In addition to this, we learn what are the most common predefined macros and also how to include guard our header files. We apply these concepts in some exercises prescribe in the ALX SE programe. Below are the files in this directory the functions they perform:
- [0-object\_like\_macro.h](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/0-object_like_macro.h)	is a header file that defines a micro names `SIZE` as an abbreviation of the token `1024`.
- [1-pi.h]((https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h)	defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
- [2-main.c]((https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/2-main.c)	prints the name of the file it was compiled from.
- [3-function\_like\_macro.h]((https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/3-function_like_macro.h)	has a function-like macro `ABS(x)` which computes the absolute value of the number `x`.
- [4-sum.h]((https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/4-sum.h)	has function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` which  computes the sum of the the numbers `x` and `y`.
