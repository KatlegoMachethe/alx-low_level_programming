#Pointers to functions

In this directory we look into pointers to functions (as per the header). Specifically, we learn what are function pointers and how do we use them, what does a function pointer exactly hold and where does a function pointer point to in virtual memory. We then apply these concept that we learn from the recomended resources to the practical coding problems [0x0F. C - Function pointers](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/projects/226) as prescribed in the ALX SE programme. Below is a list of files in this directory and the functions they perform:
- [0-print\_name.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/0-print_name.c)	prints a name.
- [1-array\_iterator.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/1-array_iterator.c)	has a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
- [2-int\_index.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/2-int_index.c)	searches for an iteger.
- [function\_pointers.h](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/function_pointers.h)	contains prototupes for some functions.
